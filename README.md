# Collaborative Image Editor

Use `npm run build` to run the app locally. 

This is a simple web-based image editor that allows users to upload, edit and share images with other users.
Any shared images can be edited by any of the collaboraters, and changes will be updated for all collaboraters.
Users can adjust the brightness, contrast or saturation of an image, or apply a grayscale, sepia or inverted filter. 
Jimp was used to support the image editing functions.
